1. if a pawn is at the safety entry point, and an opposite player lands on it, it doesn't capture the pawn, instead is allowing both to be on the same cell.  What should happen according to the official rules?


According to the official Sorry! rules, the scenario you described where both pawns remain on the same cell is incorrect.

Here's what should happen based on standard rules:

The Space is Not Safe: The space immediately outside your Safety Zone entrance (the triangle/arrow space) is part of the main board path. It does not offer any special protection like the actual Safety Zone spaces do.
Standard Bumping Rule: If an opponent's pawn lands by exact count on any space on the main path that is occupied by your pawn, your pawn is bumped.
Bump Means Back to START: Being "bumped" means your pawn is immediately sent back to its own colored START space.
"Sorry!" Moment: This is one of the core mechanics of the game, hence the name "Sorry!" (as the player bumping often says this).
Therefore, in the situation you described:

Your pawn is on the space just outside your Safety Zone entrance (on the main path).
An opponent's pawn lands on that exact same space.
Your pawn should be bumped back to your START space. The opponent's pawn then occupies that space.
Allowing both pawns to occupy the same space on the main path is typically considered a house rule and is not part of the official gameplay published by Hasbro. The only places pawns are inherently safe from being bumped are their own START space and their own color SAFETY ZONE path.
